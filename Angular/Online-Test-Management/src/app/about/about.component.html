<h2><b>Team Gauss</b></h2>
<h3>This Online Test Management System is a result of our joint effort to complete the project.<br> 
    This Project was assigned to us in the Sprint-2 of Capgemini training, to evaluate our understanding of concepts learned during the training period and teamwork. <br>
    We thank Capgemini to provide this opportunity to us, and our trainers and mentor for their support.<br>
    Our team is named after Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to many fields in mathematics and science.<br>
    This project is also a little contribution of us to help people by providing them a platform to test their knowledge and learning.<br>
    The members of team Gauss are as follows :</h3>

              <p>The training was fun and rewarding and a little bit tough as there were many new things to learn. The trainers were very helping and good.
                I learnt many new concepts and technologies and also the correct structural way to make a project. My task was to implement complete frontend and backend of Assign test to user, login & logout,and AboutUs and Contact Us section.
                I experienced how the development of projects take place in companies with modular approach and cooperation within a team. The best part when we completed our assigned project. 
                Thankyou Capgemini for this great experience.ðŸš©ðŸ˜Š</p>
